üè° House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property-specific factors. It aims to provide accurate, data-driven real estate valuations for buyers, sellers, and agents.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance

Trained using regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Model evaluation through metrics like RMSE, R¬≤ score, and cross-validation

Deployed via a Django-based web interface for real-time price prediction

Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Deployment: Django, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap# House-Price-Prediction
